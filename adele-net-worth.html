( Updated 2022)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Adele</a> is a well-known and famous British singer/songwriter. Adele earned around $430 million between 2009 and 2019, mostly from record sales and live performances. She has a net worth of $220 million as of this writing.</p><p>Something about Adele’s voice connects with almost everyone. Perhaps it’s her lyric choices, her phrasing, her tone, or something more intangible. Whatever it was, it helped her debut album, “19,” become multi-Platinum on many countries, and it helped her second record become one of the most award-winning albums of all time. She has won five American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, 20 Billboard Year-End Awards (for singles that set records the previous year), four BRIT Awards, one Golden Globe, nine Grammy Awards, and one Oscar since the release of her first single in 2007.</p><p>Out of 188 nominations, she garnered 107 major music awards for her two studio albums. That’s a pretty good average. She has sold seven million copies of her debut album and 26 million copies of her second album, “21,” globally to date. Her songs have been played on international radio numerous times, as well as in reality singing competitions, commercials, films, mechanical toys, and at your local karaoke bar. As a result, Adele has made a sizable profit from royalties alone. In fact, she reportedly earns $62,000 per day from royalties.</p><table class=celeb_stats_table><tbody readability=5><tr class=row-fill><td width=50%>Net Worth:</td><td width=50%>$220 Million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td width=50%>Date of Birth:</td><td width=50%>May 5, 1988 (34 years old)</td></tr><tr><td width=50%>Place of Birth:</td><td width=50%>Tottenham</td></tr><tr><td width=50%>Gender:</td><td width=50%>Female</td></tr><tr><td width=50%>Height:</td><td width=50%>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr readability=7><td width=50%>Profession:</td><td width=50%>Musician, Composer, Singer-songwriter, Multi-instrumentalist, Music Arranger, Actor</td></tr><tr><td width=50%>Nationality:</td><td width=50%>England</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=early-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on May 5, 1988, in Tottenham, London. Adele is her stage name, and she is most recognized for it. Her father abandoned her when she was two years old, and she was raised solely by her mother, Penny Adkins. They moved to Brighton on England’s south coast when she was nine years old, before returning to London in 1999.</p><p>She graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon in 2006, where she was classmates with renowned singers Leona Lewis and Jessie J. Her primary focus in school was on getting into the A&R side of the music industry, rather than beginning her own singing career. However, as part of a class project, she had recorded a three-song demo, which a friend posted on Myspace, where it quickly became popular. Richard Russell of XL Recordings contacted her as a result of her online exposure, and she signed with them in September 2006.</p><h2 id=music-career><span class=ez-toc-section id=Music_Career></span><strong>Music Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele’s debut single, “Hometown Glory,” was released in October 2007. Her debut studio album “19,” released in 2008, was a critical and commercial triumph. The RIAA certified the album gold in early 2009, and it had sold 2.2 million copies worldwide by July 2009. At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in February 2009, she also won Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.</p><p>Adele’s second studio album, “21,” was released in early 2011, and reached number one in over 30 countries. Popular singles from the album included “Someone Like You” and “Rolling in the Deep,” both of which reached the top of the charts in numerous countries. “21” was so popular that by December 2011, it had sold over 3.4 million copies in the United Kingdom alone, making it the best-selling album of the twenty-first century at the time, surpassing Amy Winehouse’s album “Back to Black.” Adele won three wins at the 2011 American Music Awards and six at the 2012 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year.</p><p>Adele released her third studio album “25” in November 2015, following a brief vacation from performing during which she continued to work on fresh material. With 17.4 million copies sold, it was the best-selling book in the world in 2015. She also went on tour for the first time since 2011 in 2016. Over 10 million individuals tried to get tickets for the North American leg of the tour, but only 750,000 were available. Her first three studio albums were all named after her age when she was working on them, though she has mentioned that she will most likely not do so with her next album.</p><p>Adele’s other notable musical efforts, aside from her studio albums, include the title song for “Skyfall,” the 23rd James Bond film. The song, popularly known as “Skyfall,” has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, earning Adele a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, an Academy Award for Best Original Song, and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Adele has sold over 100 million records globally in total.</p><h2 id=las-vegas-residency-earnings><span class=ez-toc-section id=Las_Vegas_Residency_Earnings></span><strong>Las Vegas Residency Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele announced a residency in Las Vegas between January 21st and April 16th, 2021, in late 2021. The show is estimated to produce $2 million in gross income per show, according to projections. If Adele receives half of the money, she will receive $13 million. That is more than any other musician has ever received per show in Las Vegas.</p><h2 id=personal-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele married Simon Konecki in 2016 following a five-year relationship. They have only one kid together, a son born in 2012. After 7 years together, they announced their breakup in April 2019. Adele’s lack of a prenuptial agreement with Simon was discovered in April 2020, putting her on the hook for a possibly massive compensation. During the marriage, the couple’s primary legal residence was the state of California in the United States. An ex-spouse in California is entitled to 50% of any income and assets generated during the marriage. Adele made about $200 million before taxes during their marriage, according to our calculations.</p><p>They also amassed a sizable real estate holdings during their marriage. Simon will be legally entitled to half of the portfolio’s value or some other arrangement. The newlyweds paid $9.5 million for their Beverly Hills house in June 2016. Adele spent $10.65 million for a new Beverly Hills house in May 2019, a month after announcing their divorce.</p><p>Adele’s request to keep her divorce details private was granted by a Los Angeles court on April 6, 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Adele-1.jpg><h2 id=real-estate><span class=ez-toc-section id=Real_Estate></span><strong>Real Estate</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele’s primary abode for many years was a $11 million estate in West Sussex, England. She tried to sell the mansion in 2016 for $11 million but was unable to find a buyer. She also owns a huge Beverly Hills property that she purchased in 2016 for $9.5 million. Penelope Cruz, Jennifer Lawrence, Zoe Saldana, and Nicole Richie are among her LA neighbors. As previously reported, Adele spent $10.65 million on a new Beverly Hills home a month after announcing their divorce.</p><h2 id=adele-career-earnings><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adele_Career_Earnings></span><strong>Adele Career Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>2008: $10 million</li><li>2009: $5 million</li><li>2010: $5 million</li><li>2011: $15 million</li><li>2012: $18 million</li><li>2013: $30 million</li><li>2014: $70 million</li><li>2015: $60 million</li><li>2016: $80 million</li><li>2017: $70 million</li><li>2018: $20 million</li><li>2019: $20 million</li><li>2020:$10 million</li><li>2021: $20 million</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Total_433_million></span>Total:&nbsp;<strong>$433 million</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h2 id=adele-net-worth-milestones><span class=ez-toc-section id=Adele_Net_Worth_Milestones></span><strong>Adele Net Worth Milestones</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adele’s net worth was originally listed on CelebrityNetWorth in 2009, when she had a net worth of $5 million.
