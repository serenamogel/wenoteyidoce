The series premiere starred Alex Michel.</p><p>While Michel did pick a contestant at the end of the season, that relationship did not last. 18 years later, it appears that 49-year-old Alex Michel is currently single and has not been married.</p><p>It is worth noting that Michel has stayed largely out of the spotlight after starring on the reality show, so the possibility that he has married and kept that part of his life private has not been ruled out.
