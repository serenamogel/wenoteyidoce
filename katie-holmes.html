She was accepted at Columbia University in New York but opted to kick-start her acting career, instead. She began acting in 1997, when she was 19, and has since appeared in several movies, TV shows, and plays.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Dawson’s Creek and Other TV Roles" data-anchor-id=dawsons-creek-and-other-tv-roles class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Dawson’s Creek and Other TV Roles</h2><img alt="michelle williams, james van der beek, katie holmes, and joshua jackson stand next to each other for a photo with a body of water and a sunset behind them" title="The cast of 'Dawson's Creek'" width=1845 height=2103 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-cast-of-dawsons-creek-from-left-to-right-michelle-news-photo-1699287938.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Michelle Williams, James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, and Joshua Jackson starred in Dawson’s Creek, beginning in 1998.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Holmes had earlier film roles, her breakout role was as Joey Potter on Dawson’s Creek. Across six seasons, the teenager grows up in the fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts, and dates different love interests. Fans were ultimately torn between which one Joey should have ended up with: Dawson, played by James Van Der Beek, or Pacey, played by Joshua Jackson. Holmes’ performance as Joey earned her several Teen Choice Award nominations across the span of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2003.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dawson’s Creek was mostly filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Holmes previously noted that she found it difficult to leave the town and her role once the show wrapped <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hellomagazine.com/profiles/20091008747/katie-holmes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=saying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">saying</a>, “so much of me is in Joey, and it really felt like I grew up on television.” Holmes has also credited her age at the time of filming Dawson’s Creek for helping her easily connect with her on-screen persona. “I was still a teenager, and it was nice to read a script that felt like it expressed things that I was still trying to understand for myself,” Holmes later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/28/dawsons-creek-reunion-casting-stories/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=shared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shared</a> with Entertainment Weekly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Holmes’ breakout role almost didn’t happen.

Luckily for Holmes, her audition tape performance was so good that it convinced Williamson she was the perfect fit for the lead role. Dawson’s Creek was one of The WB’s most popular shows, premiering to 6.8 million viewers, which Vox <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/25/16911234/dawsons-creek-20-years-love-triangle-joey-pacey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reports class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">reports</a> was the highest rating for the network.
