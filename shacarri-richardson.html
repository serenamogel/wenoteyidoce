She was born and raised in Dallas, where she began running at age 9 and became a successful sprinter in middle school and high school. Richardson then attended Louisiana State University for one year before turning professional in 2019. After a positive drug test prevented her from competing in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Richardson’s career dipped until she became the “world’s fastest woman” after winning the 100-meter dash at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in record time.

Growing up, Richardson didn’t have a relationship with her biological parents. Instead, she was raised by her grandmother, Betty Harp, and aunt Shayaria Richardson, whom she calls her mother.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2021, Sha’Carri announced her biological mother’s death and declined to discuss her mom in detail beyond <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/06/19/shacarri-richardson-dominates-us-olympic-track-and-field-trials-100/7757848002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=saying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">saying</a>, “I am grateful for her giving me life, bringing me into this world.” She hasn’t publicly spoken or acknowledged who her father is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Richardson was inspired to start running at a young age. Shayaria was a successful track and field runner, and at age 9, Sha’Carri found her mother’s medals from her high school running career. “My grandmother made [my mother] a big plaque full of medals, and I saw it one day and was like, ‘I want that. I want you to bring me one, Granny.’ And [my grandmother] was like, ‘Well you got to do something to get some medals!’” Richardson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/shacarri-richardson-profile data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Teen Vogue" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Teen Vogue</a> in 2022. “And honestly from then on it was just like, ‘If you want to do something, if you want to be great, you got to put your all into it.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An active child whom Shayaria described as a tomboy, Richardson spent her time at cheer and dance practices, playing football with neighborhood boys, and of course, running. “I knew right from the start that we were going to be in it for the long haul. She was committed. I would get home from work and she would ask me to take her to the track,” Shayaria <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/06/shacarri-richardson-olympics-eugene-tokyo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told D Magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told D Magazine</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="High School and College" data-anchor-id=high-school-and-college class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">High School and College</h2><img alt="four women run on a track while wearing skintight running uniforms and bibs with their names on them" title="Sha'Carri Richardson and competitors at the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championships" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anglerne-annelus-of-the-usc-trojans-beats-out-shacarri-news-photo-1712157107.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>After attracting national attention as a high schooler, Sha’Carri Richardson, second from right, ran for Louisiana State University for one year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Richardson began competing in track races during middle school, where she won regional and state championships. In 2016, she gained national recognition as a sophomore at David W. Carter High School in Dallas when she became the Amateur Athletic Union Junior Olympics Champion in the 100 meters. In 2017, Richardson earned a bronze medal in the 200 meters at the USA Track and Field (USATF) National Junior Olympic Track and Field Championships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Richardson committed to running at Louisiana State University in 2017. After graduating high school the following year, Richardson was the No. 1-ranked sprint recruit in the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a freshman at Louisiana State University, Richardson won her first NCAA title in 2019 and set a new collegiate record for the 100-meter dash, recording a time of 10.75 seconds. With a record under her belt, Richardson decided to withdraw from the university and set her sights even higher.

After crossing the finish line and running into the stands, she shared an emotional moment with her grandmother. “My grandmother is my heart. My grandmother is my superwoman,” Richardson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2021/06/19/shacarri-richardson-dominates-us-olympic-track-and-field-trials-100/7757848002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. “Honestly, that was one of my biggest goals in life: to have her see me compete in one of the highest levels and be successful.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, that July, results came back from a routine drug test performed by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on the day of her Olympic Trials race: Richardson had tested positive for marijuana. She was subsequently banned from competition for one month and disqualified from competing at the Tokyo Olympics in August 2021. Richardson shared that her marijuana use occurred at the time of her biological mother’s death in June 2021 to help her cope with the loss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I want to take responsibility for my actions,” Richardson said <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/shacarri-richardson-tests-positive-marijuana-olympic-100-meters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on the Today show" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">on the Today show</a>. “I know what I did.

She finished in a disappointing last place in the 100-meter event at the Prefontaine Classic in August 2021. In June 2022, she also failed to reach the semifinals at the USATF Outdoor Championships in the 100-meter and 200-meter events. As a result, she was absent at the 2022 World Athletics Championships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, in June 2023, Richardson began to find her footing at the front of the pack once more.
