Joey Jordison is best known as the original drummer and founding member of the heavy metal band Slipknot. He also formed several more metal bands, including Murderdolls and Scar the Martyr, and performed with Ministry, Rob Zombie, Otep, and Satyricon. Jordison was a member of the global death metal ensemble Sinsaenum at the time of his death in 2021.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Joey Jordison die?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Joey Jordison</a> discussed having acute transverse myelitis in a Metal Hammer interview in 2017. Its symptoms began in 2010 while touring with Murderdolls, but the sickness was not discovered until much later. This resulted in him losing the use of his left leg.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Prior to rehabilitation, his neurological illness had deprived him of the use of his legs and rendered him unable to play the drums. He healed with the help of medical assistance and physical treatment, as well as his trainer Caleb.</p><p>Jordison died peacefully in his sleep on July 26, 2021, at the age of 46, according to his family the following day. Later, 911 call tapes from Jordison’s ex-girlfriend, Amanda Victoria, were revealed, in which she reported a terrible odor upon entering Jordison’s garage and that neither she nor Jordison’s family had heard from him in days. Jordison was pronounced deceased on the scene. Jordison was laid to rest in Highland Memory Gardens Cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa, near fellow Slipknot founding member and bassist Paul Grey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where was Joey Jordison buried?</h2><p>Jordison was laid to rest in Highland Memory Gardens Cemetery in Des Moines, Iowa, near fellow Slipknot founding member and bassist Paul Grey.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Meanwhile, Jordison formed Modifidious as a teenager, and the band performed live as a support act for several local musicians. Before disbanding in early 1995, Modifidious published five demo albums. Jordison later joined a local band named the Rejects for a short time. He was also a member of the Anal Blast and the Have Nots bands.</p><p>Slipknot was created in 1995 by Jordison, bassist Paul Grey, and percussionist Shawn Crahan. The band was then joined by vocalist Anders Colsefni, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh Brainard, and bassist Chris Smith. Slipknot released the album “Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.” in 1996 with this original lineup; since then, the band has undergone multiple changes. The band eventually decided on a nine-piece roster, with Jordison labeled as “#1.” Sid Wilson joined in 1998, and Corey Taylor in 1997.</p><p>Slipknot rose to prominence in 1999 with their self-titled debut album, which peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200. The band’s success rose over time, with their third album, “Iowa,” debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and topping the UK Albums Chart in 2001. Slipknot returned after a brief sabbatical with “Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses),” which reached number two on the Billboard 200 in 2004. The album was backed up by the successful lead song “Duality.” Slipknot’s first live album, “9.0: Live,” was released in late 2005. Slipknot’s next studio album, “All Hope Is Gone,” debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 2008.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>www.ghgossip.com</a></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2grJufq7Kzeceormain5rGbrbOq5uiq5%2BjeqW1xJ1kmqaUYsSpsdGeZKGdXayutHnBrqminZRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./j-t-realmuto.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="J.
