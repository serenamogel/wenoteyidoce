Ziggy and his siblings formed the Melody Makers in 1981 after their father’s death. Their 1988 album, Conscious Party, won a Grammy and helped the group break through to mainstream audiences. Marley began a solo career in 2006 and went on to record several more Grammy Award–winning albums, including his self-titled 2016 studio effort.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: David Nesta Marley<br>BORN: October 17, 1968<br>BIRTHPLACE: Kingston, Jamaica<br>SPOUSE: Orly Agai (2004-present)<br>CHILDREN: Bambaata, Justice, Zuri, Judah, Gideon, Abraham, and Isaiah<br>PARENTS: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bob-marley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Marley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bob Marley</a> and Rita Marley<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Libra</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ziggy Marley was born as David Nesta Marley on October 17, 1968, in Kingston, Jamaica. The oldest son of reggae great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bob-marley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Marley" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bob Marley</a> and wife Rita Marley, Ziggy spent some of his early years growing up in Trench Town, one of Kingston’s poorest neighborhoods, as his father tried to make a success of his band, the Wailers (later Bob Marley and the Wailers). Rita, also a talented singer, joined the group in the mid-1970s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in his youth, Ziggy spent some time in Wilmington, Delaware, where his younger brother Stephen was born in 1972. He already had an older sister, Cedella, and an older half-sister, Sharon, from his mother’s previous relationship. By 1978, Ziggy had seven more half-siblings, all products of his parents’ extramarital affairs: Stephanie, born to his mother, as well as Robert, Rohan, Karen, Julian, Ky-Mani, and Damian, on his father’s side.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1979, Ziggy, Cedella, Stephen, and Sharon recorded their first song together, “Children Playing in the Streets.” Written by their father, the single addressed the horrible poverty that many children in Jamaica were living in. Royalties from the song were donated to the United Nations Children’s Fund.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="The Melody Makers" data-anchor-id=the-melody-makers class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">The Melody Makers</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his father’s death in 1981, Ziggy performed with Stephen at Bob’s funeral. They went on to form the Melody Makers with Sharon and Cedella. While all four members provided the vocals, Ziggy also played guitar, an instrument his father had taught him. Stephen played the guitar as well and the drums. Performing as the Melody Makers, they released their next single, “What a Plot,” later in 1981.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1985, the Melody Makers released their first album, Play the Game Right, which failed to garner much success. Their next effort, Hey World! (1986), met a similar fate, though it did receive many positive reviews.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Breakthrough Album</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Changing names, the group became Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers and released Conscious Party (1988) with Virgin Records. The album helped the group break through to mainstream audiences. Produced by Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth of the Talking Heads, it incorporated elements of reggae, pop, and rock.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Handling much of the writing, Ziggy managed to imbue the songs with an upbeat, positive quality while remaining topical and thought-provoking. The track “Tomorrow People” became popular with many listeners, and the album did well on both the pop and R&B/hip-hop charts in the United States. In early 1989, the group brought home the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Later Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With their next record, One Bright Day (1989), Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers had another critical success on their hands and earned a second consecutive Grammy for Best Reggae Album. However, sales didn’t match those of their previous studio effort.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The group made several more albums together in the 1990s, including the Grammy Award–winning Fallen Is Babylon (1997), before disbanding.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 title="Solo Music Career" data-anchor-id=solo-music-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Solo Music Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers broke up, Ziggy has continued the family’s involvement in the music scene, making a name for himself as one of the genre’s leading artists in the process.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Marley released his first solo album, Dragonfly, in 2003. He had a number of guests on the recording, including Flea and John Frusciante from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the entire album had a strong rock and hip-hop flair to it. The songs explored social, political, and personal topics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His next effort, Love Is My Religion (2006), won the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. Marley continued to deliver critically acclaimed music, both as a solo artist and alongside family members and other celebrated performers like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/donna-summer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donna Summer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Donna Summer</a>. His self-titled 2016 album took home the Grammy for Best Reggae Album, giving him a record seven Grammy wins in that category.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 title="Wife and Children" data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to his music, Marley established the U.R.G.E. (Unlimited Resources Giving Enlightment) organization to help children in poverty.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Marley’s wife is Orly Agai. The couple married in December 2004 and share four children: Judah, Gideon, Abraham, and Isaiah. Marley is also father to three kids—Daniel, who goes by “Bambaata;” Justice; and Zuri—from previous relationships.</p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
