At the 1984 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal in the 200-meter run. She later married fellow Olympian Al Joyner, the brother of famed athlete <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/jackie-joyner-kersee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jackie Joyner-Kersee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a>. In 1988, she set world records in the 100- and 200-meter events that still stand today. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Joyner took home three gold medals and a silver. She and her coach, Bob Kersee, came under media speculation when rumors spread that she might have used performance-enhancing drugs to improve her times. Joyner vigorously denied these accusations, and they were never proven. Joyner died unexpectedly in September 1998, at age 38, after suffering an epileptic seizure.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Florence Delorez Griffith-Joyner<br>BORN: December 21, 1959<br>DIED: September 21, 1998<br>BIRTHPLACE: Los Angeles, California<br>SPOUSE: Al Joyner (1987-1998)<br>CHILD: Mary<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Early Life of a Collegiate Champion" data-anchor-id=early-life-of-a-collegiate-champion class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life of a Collegiate Champion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Florence Joyner, known widely as “Flo Jo,” was born Florence Delorez Griffith on December 21, 1959, in Los Angeles. Joyner began running at age 7, and her gift for speed soon became apparent. At 14 years old, she won the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/jesse-owens data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jesse Owens" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jesse Owens</a> National Youth Games. She later competed for Jordan High School, where she served as the anchor on the relay team, then went on to race at the college level.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She attended California State University at Northridge and ran for their track team under coach Bob Kersee, who continued to coach her for several years. She left school for financial reasons, but in 1980, Joyner enrolled at the University of California Los Angeles, where Kersee had recently accepted a position as an assistant track coach. She quickly earned a reputation as a track star. She became an NCAA champion in 1982 with a victory in the 200-meter event. The following year, she took the top spot in the 400-meter event. She graduated in 1983 with a degree in psychology.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 title="Olympic Medalist and World Record Holder" data-anchor-id=olympic-medalist-and-world-record-holder class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Olympic Medalist and World Record Holder</h2><img alt="florence joyner runs on a track with her arms straight over her head, she smiles and wears a red and white singlet, white shoes and a number on her chest, yellow flowers and crowded stands are in the background" title="Florence Joyner wins the 100-meter race during the 1988 Olympic Games" width=3072 height=2040 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/florence-griffith-joyner-of-the-usa-celebrates-her-100m-win-news-photo-1709745872.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Florence Joyner, seen here at the 1988 Olympic Games, won five Olympic medals and set two world records throughout her sprinting career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Coached by Bob Kersee, Joyner made her Olympic debut in 1984, at the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. There, she won a silver medal for the 200-meter run and became known for her speed, form-fitting bodysuits, and brightly painted 6-inch fingernails.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the 1984 Olympic Games, Joyner entered semi-retirement, but she returned to track in the leadup to the 1988 Olympics and recommitted to training. During this time, Flo Jo trained with both Kersee and her husband, Al. Joyner’s hard work paid off. At the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials in Indianapolis, she set a new women’s world record for the 100-meter run with a time of 10.49 seconds. Shortly afterward, she dropped Kersee and selected her husband to be her full-time coach.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Female Track Stars</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the 1988 Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, South Korea, she took home gold medals in the 4-by-100 meter relay and the 100- and 200-meter runs as well as a silver medal in the 4-by-400 meter relay. She also set a world record for the 200-meter run with a time of 21.34 seconds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Joyner’s Olympic performance brought her all kinds of other accolades. She was named the Associated Press’ Female Athlete of the Year and Track and Field magazine’s Athlete of the Year. Joyner also won the Sullivan Award for best amateur athlete.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 title="Iconic Style and Nails" data-anchor-id=iconic-style-and-nails class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Iconic Style and Nails</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Throughout her athletic career, Flo Jo was known for her strong sense of style. Even as a child, she displayed great creativity and a bold fashion sense. She sewed clothes for her dolls and tried on her mother’s dresses, and she was once asked to leave a mall for wearing a pet snake around her neck as an accessory. As an adult, she channeled that creativity into styling her friends’ hair and nails.</p><img alt="florence joyners hands hold four medals on red, white, blue and yellow striped ribbons, her long nails are bejeweled and painted several colors" title="Florence Joyner displays her 1998 Olympic medals and her characteristically dazzling fingernails" width=1024 height=721 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/close-up-as-american-athlete-florence-griffith-joyner-news-photo-1709745651.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Flo Jo was known for her style, including her long, brightly painted nails.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Joyner’s outfits on the track were legendary. She became known for wearing unitards with bold colors, like turquoise, purple, and yellow, and unique design elements, like hoods or fabric covering only one leg. She also upended convention by competing while wearing jewelry, sporting long, brightly painted fingernails, and leaving her hair down.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 title="Retirement and Controversy" data-anchor-id=retirement-and-controversy class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Retirement and Controversy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the 1988 Olympics, Joyner retired from competition. Suspicions soon arose regarding how the so-called “world’s fastest woman” achieved her victories. Joyner and her coach, Bob Kersee, came under media speculation when another athlete suggested that Joyner had used performance-enhancing drugs. Some attributed the substantial improvements Joyner made in her performance levels from 1984 to 1988 to illegal substances. Others thought that her incredibly muscular physique had to have been created with the help of performance-enhancing drugs.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Controversial Athletes</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rumors also spread regarding Kersee’s training techniques, suggesting he could have been encouraging his runners to use steroids or other drugs in order to win medals. Joyner always insisted that she never used performance enhancers, and she never failed a drug test. In fact, according to CNN.com, Joyner took and passed 11 drug tests in 1988 alone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Joyner remained involved in athletics in her retirement. She was appointed co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness in 1993 and went on to establish her own foundation for children in need. Nearly six years after the Seoul Olympics, in 1995, Joyner was honored with an induction into the Track and Field Hall of Fame. Around this time, she once again began training for the Olympics. But her comeback effort was curtailed by problems with her right Achilles tendon.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She also pursued creative endeavors, including acting. In 1989, the noted fashion icon was hired to design the uniforms for the Indiana Pacers basketball team. The Pacers used her design for seven seasons, coinciding with the team’s rise to prominence in the early to mid-nineties.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 title="Husband and Daughter" data-anchor-id=husband-and-daughter class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Husband and Daughter</h2><img alt="florence joyner and al joyner sit on a couch together and smile at the camera, she wears a blue and gold patterned long sleeve blouse with black pants and bright pink nails, he wears a brown striped sweater and dark khakis, behind them is a window with drapes, a lamp and an indoor plant" title="Florence Joyner and Al Joyner, circa 1988, were married for nearly 11 years" width=3155 height=3163 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/husband-and-wife-track-and-field-athletes-florence-griffith-news-photo-1709745399.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Florence Joyner and her husband, Al Joyner, at their Los Angeles home, circa 1988</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1987, Florence Griffith married Al Joyner, the 1984 triple jump Olympic gold medalist and brother of famed athlete <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/jackie-joyner-kersee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jackie Joyner-Kersee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jackie Joyner-Kersee</a>.

Al was immediately smitten, but the two didn’t start dating until 1986, when Al came to Los Angeles to train for the 1988 Olympics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Al proposed to Joyner on July 17, 1987, and the couple initially planned to get married later the following year. However, an earthquake struck Los Angeles on October 1, and Flo Jo was spooked—she was suddenly afraid of dying before getting married. So they drove to Las Vegas and were married on October 10, 1987.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On November 13, 1990, the couple’s only child, Mary, was born. As a child, Mary competed in gymnastics and displayed a talent for singing—something her mother always yearned for. As she grew older, Mary also dabbled in track. Al continued coaching, including stints at UCLA and the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. He remarried in 2003.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Mary pursued a career as a singer, and she even appeared on America’s Got Talent in 2012. She also co-wrote and produced Flo Jo: A Daughter's Love, a short documentary about her mother, which was released in 2023.
