Christie published her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1920 and went on to become one of the most famous writers in history with 83 books to her name (and her pseudonym, Mary Westmacott). She also became a noted playwright with The Mousetrap, which is still running today on London’s West End. Christie died in January 1976 at age 85 and remains one of the top-selling authors ever, with her combined works selling more than 2 billion copies worldwide.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller<br>BORN: September 15, 1890<br>DIED: January 12, 1976<br>BIRTHPLACE: Torquay, England<br>SPOUSES: Archie Christie (1914-1928) and Max Mallowan (1930-1976)<br>CHILDREN: Rosalind<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Agatha Christie was born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller on September 15, 1890, in Torquay, Devon, in the southwest part of England. The youngest of three siblings, she was educated at home by her mother, who encouraged her daughter to write. As a child, Agatha enjoyed fantasy play and creating characters, and, when she was 16, she moved to Paris for a time to study vocals and piano.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Husbands, Daughter, and Disappearance" data-anchor-id=husbands-daughter-and-disappearance class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Husbands, Daughter, and Disappearance</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 1912, Agatha met Archibald “Archie” Christie at a dance. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/blog/archives/desert-island-doc-agatha-christies-wartime-wedding data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The pair became engaged in 1913" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The pair became engaged in 1913</a>, just before Archie entered military training. At the outset of World War I, he was stationed in France and became a pilot. The couple married during his first period of leave, on Christmas Eve in 1914, and they relocated to London at the conclusion of the war.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Agatha and Archie had one child, Rosalind Hicks, born in August 1919.

Christie’s disappearance set off a manhunt involving both police and civilians. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20speople-investigating-the-strange-disappearance-of-mrs-agatha-christie data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to the U.K. National Archives" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to the U.K. National Archives</a>, her flight became a media sensation and writer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/arthur-conan-doyle data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Arthur Conan Doyle" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> even consulted a medium in an attempt to find her whereabouts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On December 14, a stranger recognized Christie at the Swan Hydro hotel in Harrogate, where she had checked in using Neele’s name. She had no recollection of the prior 11 days, and her biographer later wrote she was in a “fugue” state caused by trauma or depression. However, some believed she had left on purpose to embarrass her husband. Christie ultimately recovered, with she and Archie finally divorcing in 1928.</p><img alt="max mallowan and agatha christie stand next to each other and smile while looking ahead" title="Max Mallowan and Agatha Christie in 1933" width=3632 height=2793 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/agatha-christie-and-husband-british-archaeologist-max-news-photo-1712011477.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Max Mallowan and Agatha Christie, seen here in 1933, were married for more than 45 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1930, Agatha remarried with archaeology professor Max Mallowan, with whom she traveled on several expeditions, later recounting her trips in the 1946 memoir Come, Tell Me How You Live.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=17 title=Books data-anchor-id=books class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she was growing her family, Christie’s writing career ascended. She published her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1920. The story focused on the murder of a rich heiress and introduced readers to one of Christie’s most famous characters: Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Poirot returned in The Murder on the Links (1923) and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926), a hit that was later marked as a genre classic and one of the author’s all-time favorites. The year of Christie’s second nuptials saw the release of Murder at the Vicarage (1930), which became another classic and introduced readers to Miss Jane Marple, an enquiring village lady.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Poirot and Marple are Christie’s most well-known detectives, with the two featured in dozens of novels and short stories. Poirot made the most appearances in Christie’s work in titles that include Ackroyd, The Mystery of the Blue Train (1928), and Death in the Clouds (1935). Miss Marple was featured in books like The Moving Finger (1942) and A Pocket Full of Rye (1953) and been played onscreen by actors like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/angela-lansbury data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Angela Lansbury" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Angela Lansbury</a>, Helen Hayes, and Geraldine McEwan.

Christie’s success as an author of sleuth stories has earned her titles like the “Queen of Crime” and the “Queen of Mystery.” She also wrote romance novels like Unfinished Portrait (1934) and A Daughter’s a Daughter (1952) under the name Mary Westmacott. In total, Christie published 83 books, including works using her pseudonym.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Christie was a renowned playwright as well, with works like The Hollow (1951) and Verdict (1958). Her play The Mousetrap opened in 1952 at the Ambassador Theatre and—at more than 8,800 showings during 21 years—set the record for the longest unbroken run in a London theater.

Friends also said she had fits of anger and began to speak nonsensically in conversation. This has led to speculation that she might have suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, though Christie was never officially diagnosed. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2010/06/01/127211884/agatha-christie-and-nuns-tell-a-tale-of-alzheimers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A study by Ian Lancashire" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">A study by Ian Lancashire</a>, an English professor at the University of Toronto, showed that Christie’s vocabulary had declined by about 20 percent based on words used in 16 of her novels over a 50-year-period—giving credence to this theory.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=29 title="Movie and TV Adaptations" data-anchor-id=movie-and-tv-adaptations class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movie and TV Adaptations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Several of Christie’s works have been adapted into popular movies and television shows, including as recently as 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Murder on the Orient Express</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1974, Albert Finney starred as detective Poirot in a film version of Murder on the Orient Express, featuring an ensemble cast that included <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ingrid-bergman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ingrid Bergman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ingrid Bergman</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/lauren-bacall data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lauren Bacall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lauren Bacall</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sean-connery data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sean Connery" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sean Connery</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/vanessa-redgrave data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanessa Redgrave" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vanessa Redgrave</a>.
