As well as her personal life, net worth, and how she met Drew, we will talk about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, fans are confused about what happened to her husband—is he alive or dead? Today’s article will also help you find the answer to this question.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A short introduction to Dre McCray</strong></h2><p>Andrea McCray, also known as <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=221>Dre McCray</a>, is a social media influencer and a Tik Toker.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, she uploaded makeup tutorials to YouTube. Dre’s abilities in the cosmetics industry were praised, which increased her fan base.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is her husband, Marvon McCray?</strong></h2><p>Marvon McCray was raised by a devoted mother and was born and raised in Yuma, Arizona. He put a lot of effort into his role as a marine, dedicating himself to it.</p><p>Von found love and companionship in Dre McCray, a remarkable woman who excelled both as an entrepreneur and a social media influencer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dre-Mccray-husband.jpg><p>Marvon suffered a knee injury in 2018 that necessitated hospitalization, but he persisted and recovered well enough to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>He had a loving and aspirational nature and was always eager to try new things.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Things you should know about her relationship with her husband, Von McCray</strong></h2><p>Dre McCray and Von McCray are a couple over 8 years. Von Mccray attempted suicide and later suffered a brain injury. On the day Dre found him and called 911, Von tried to take his own life and was taken to a nearby hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of giving Von the care he needed, Dre kept Von’s condition a secret from his loved ones.</p><p>He began appearing in her social media content, she said. When Von’s mother learned about her son’s condition on social media, the hashtag “Justice For Von” was created.</p><p>Moreover, she also changed his diet to a vegan one.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Did Dre assault her husband?</strong></h2><p>Numerous users have a sneaking suspicion that she had previously used an invisible poison to kill her husband.</p><p>Most internet users are shocked as they believe she is milking her husband’s unfortunate situation to attract social media followers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/A-heartfelt-moment-between-Dre-McCray-and-her-husband-Marvon-McCray-1024x766.jpg><p>She does not seem to care as much about his security and well-being. To this end, many people call on the authorities to investigate the case and bring Von’s killer to justice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The turning point in the married life of Dre and Von</strong></h2><p>As we discussed, Dre is a social media influencer. Consequently, she posts everything related to her life on social media platforms. According to Andrea’s Instagram and TikTok videos, everything was going well.</p><p>However, everything changed when she decided to adopt a vegan lifestyle and wanted her family to do so as well. She said it would make them all healthier and disease-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They became slimmer as a result of the diet change, and many viewers wondered if Marvon also appeared sicker. However, no one intervened because nothing unexpected occurred.</p><p>Another change Andrea brought to the family was changing the herbs they used in their meals.&nbsp;</p><p>It was later discovered that Marvon had started experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p>He refused to consume the herbs, which frequently resulted in arguments with Andrea. The couple was frequently heard fighting on her streams, according to viewers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What happened to Dre Mccray husband?</strong></h2><p>Sorry to say, Von is no longer with us.&nbsp;Uncertainty surrounds the circumstances of Marvon’s death because the precise cause of death has not been revealed.</p><p>According to some sources, he made a suicide attempt and the next day fell into a coma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dre-McCray-and-Marvon-McCray-a-loving-couple.jpg><p>Family members or reliable sources have not yet offered any official updates or specific information about this situation.</p><p>Friends, family, and surviving members of Marvon’s family have come forward to confirm his passing during this difficult time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth of Dre</strong></h2><p>Nevertheless, the net worth of a person plays an important role in determining his success.</p><p>Dre McCray’s net worth is estimated to be around $285K as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kuaLAxKyrZqCfqXy4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZZSnsm65wpypmrFdncK0rsCnm2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ayesha-curry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ayesha Curry - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Instagram, Wiki">&larr;
