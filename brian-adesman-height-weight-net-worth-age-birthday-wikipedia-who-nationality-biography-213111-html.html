Brian Adesman has gained fame for<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>taking big cases to trial against powerful people and institutions, alike.&nbsp; He has been dubbed a “powerhouse” attorney by many mainstream news websites.&nbsp;<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p><h3 class=v1MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life></span><b>Early Life</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman was born on August 6, 1989, in Long Island, New York.&nbsp; He is a Leo.&nbsp; At the age of two, Brian Adesman and his family moved to a small town in Southern Oregon where he was raised.&nbsp; His mother is Dr. Robin Miller, author, medical reporter, and medical doctor who specializes in integrated medicine.&nbsp; His father is Dr. Peter Adesman, a gastroenterologist and wine maker.&nbsp; Brian Adesman has one brother, 22 months older, named David Adesman.</p><h3 class=v1MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education></span><b>Education</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=v1MsoNormal>Before becoming an attorney, Brian Adesman earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Oregon, where he majored in psychology, and minored in business.&nbsp; He graduated at the top of his class,&nbsp;<i>summa cum laude</i>, with a 4.03 GPA.&nbsp; After graduating college, Brian Adesman went on to earn his J.D. from the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, where he graduated at the top of his class, earning certificates in Media & Entertainment Law and Business Law.</p><h3 class=v1MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_and_Professional_Life></span><b>Career and Professional Life</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=v1MsoNormal>After graduating from law school, Brian Adesman worked at an AmLaw 100 law firm for over five years as a litigator.&nbsp; His practice primarily focused on complex commercial litigation, professional responsibility litigation (legal malpractice defense), and international dispute resolution.&nbsp; During his time at the firm, Brian Adesman achieved many major successes, including winning an international arbitration, where he and his trial team successfully argued trademark claims worth over $300 million following a five-week arbitration in Montreal, Canada.<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Eventually, Brian Adesman left Big Law to start his own firm, Miller Adesman, PLC.&nbsp;<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Brian Adesman is known for taking powerful institutions and people to task in court.&nbsp; In 2021, Brian Adesman filed a class action lawsuit in federal court against health insurance behemoth, Aetna Health Insurance, alleging that “in administering the Aetna Plans, Aetna treats mental health as less important than physical health.” &nbsp;Regarding the lawsuit, Brian Adesman was reported in the media saying, “Insurance companies are not above the law and profits can’t come before people.”</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>That same year, Brian Adesman sued Caesar “the Dog Whisperer” Milan.&nbsp; In that lawsuit, Brian Adesman alleged that Mr. Milan’s dog, Junior, killed Queen Latifah’s dog and that Mr. Milan covered it up, claiming the dog was hit by a car.&nbsp; Until that lawsuit was filed, this information had never come to light in the press.&nbsp; Mr. Milan later publicly denied the incident occurred.&nbsp; In response, Brian Adesman reportedly made the following comments to the press:</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Basically, as lawyers, we have a duty to investigate any potential case that we’re going to file in court.&nbsp; And we’re also considered officers of the court and we have an obligation to make sure that any claims we allege are supported by evidence, and that they’re not frivolous, and that they’re not untrue.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>And so, before we draft and file any complaint in any case, we will investigate the surrounding circumstances.&nbsp; That can entail a bunch of different things, up to hiring private investigators, or interviewing witnesses, or talking with people who were around the scene at the time of the incident.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>And [the fact that Junior Killed Queen Latifah’s dog] was something that we uncovered and definitely corroborated with lots of evidence.&nbsp; And it’s currently, it’s something that they deny, and that Cesar Millan has denied ever since the story broke.&nbsp; But I can assure you that I have seen the evidence and we feel very confident in making the claim that the incident did, in fact, happen.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman is known for being equal parts aggressive and creative in his approach to litigation and trial. &nbsp;He is also known for providing unique insight into complex legal issues as a legal correspondent.&nbsp;<span class=v1apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class=v1MsoNormal><span class=ez-toc-section id=Body_Measurements_and_Social_Media></span><b>Body Measurements and Social Media</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman is 5 foot 11 inches tall and weighs a healthy 77 kg.</p><p class=v1MsoNormal>Brian Adesman’s twitter handle is <a href=# rel=noopener>@BrianAdesman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaJqlqLavsdKspJqmX5e%2Fqq3NZpidnaOirq95x56goKCkYsSmtcahq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mmZeaeqO10a2fnZmpYsSqt8ipnJ2hkWLEqbuMp5itoZ%2Bjrq2107Jkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZGtpY2Z%2BcnrHraSl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./niko-terho-height-age-girlfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-13401-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Niko Terho Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
