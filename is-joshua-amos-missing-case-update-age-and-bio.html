Joshua has not been seen or heard from since March 19, 2023.</strong></p><p>Christina maintains optimism in the face of eight weeks and one day has passed, maintaining the belief that information regarding her son’s whereabouts may be available and that he is secure.</p><p>She further stated that they are anticipating with great anticipation a single crucial suggestion that may contribute to Joshua’s breakthrough.</p><p>Joshua is the fifth child of Christina, who raised her seven children in Caseyville, Illinois. The mother of four older sisters and two younger siblings, Joshua is the fifth child in her family.</p><p>Joshua, who was raised in a small town, cultivated a profound fondness for rural areas and delighted in outdoor activities, specifically creek exploration and embracing the natural world.</p><h2><span id=Joshua_Amos_Missing_Or_Found>Joshua Amos Missing Or Found?</span></h2><p>Concern among Internet users regarding the whereabouts of Joshua Amos has generated headlines on online news portals.</p><p>At the moment of his disappearance, Joshua Amos was residing with housemates in Granite City, Illinois, which is situated around 20 minutes distance from Caseyville.</p><p>According to Christina Simpson, the mother of Josh, their last conversation occurred on March 17 and appeared to be routine.</p><p>His daughters and his plans for the forthcoming weekend were subjects of conversation. Josh had recently started a new position at Precoat Metals in Granite City, which he perceived favorably due to its competitive salary. Despite this, he was compelled to work long hours at his job.</p><p>Unfortunately, Christina’s last known communication with her son occurred on March 19.</p><p>That day, she was the recipient of a distressing phone call from her youngest son, who apprised her of the disappearance of Josh.</p><p>Josh, he explained, had gone out with his companions; however, no one had heard from him since. Christina’s youngest son expeditiously notified the Washington Park Police Department of Josh’s disappearance out of concern for his whereabouts.</p><p>The information contained in this paraphrased account was disclosed by Christina Simpson in the course of her interview.</p><h2><span id=Joshua_Amos_case_update>Joshua Amos case update</span></h2><p>In the early hours of March 19, Christina Simpson reports that Josh and three companions visited Scarlett’s Cabaret, a nightclub situated in Washington Park.</p><p>Granite City is approximately sixteen minutes by car from the club. Christina elaborated that their duration of stay at the club on Sunday was around 4:58 a.m.</p><p>Video recordings captured from the parking lot of the club indicate that Josh exits the establishment and subsequently departs on his own.</p><p>Christina added that she had conversations with her companion Josh that evening. Based on their testimonies, they reported that Josh abruptly disregarded them and departed. Even so, one of his companions remained behind in an attempt to find him but was unsuccessful.</p><p>The paraphrased account presented herein is predicated upon the statements made by Christina Simpson during her interview with Dateline.</p><h2><span id=Age_and_Bio_of_Joshua_Amos>Age and Bio of Joshua Amos</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Joshua Amos, who was born in 1991, is 33 years old, per the sources. Amos’s physical attributes are as follows: 5’11” in height, 190 lbs in weight, brown hair, and brown eyes.</p><p>He was dressed in blue denim, a light grey long-sleeve crewneck shirt, and black Adidas tennis shoes at the time of his disappearance.</p><p>Josh’s tattoo collection is particularly noteworthy; it includes the names of his daughters, Bella and Mia, as well as a Chinese symbol adorning his right bicep. It is noteworthy to mention that he walks unconventionally as a result of lower back discomfort.</p><p>We strongly urge anyone with any information concerning the whereabouts of Joshua Amos to contact the Washington Park Police Department at (618) 874-0115.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/personal-details-career-and-wealth-of-gil-birmingham/"}{"1":65}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Personal Details, Career, And Wealth Of Gil Birmingham</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Son</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Elijah DeWitt Murder Case | Chandler Zion Richardson Arrested And Charged With Murder</a></h3>DeWitt was found shot to death on October 5 of the previous year in the parking lot of Sugarloaf Mills Mall, just outside Dave & Buster's.
