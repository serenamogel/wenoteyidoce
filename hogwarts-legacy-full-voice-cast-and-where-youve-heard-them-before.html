If you have missed playing in the wizarding world or want to conjure some spells for the first time, you might be excited for the newest entry in the gaming franchise, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong>, which is set 100 years before the events of Harry Potter.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=584 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>The game is an action role-playing game set in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, allowing players to go on a journey as a student, which is a concept fans have wanted for years. While the world of the game seems deep and quite large, one thing that will add to the vibrancy of the world is the game’s cast. Avalanche Software, the game’s developers, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have revealed</a> the main cast of the game as well as who they are playing. So let’s take a look at the actors appearing in Hogwarts Legacy and jog our memories to remember where we might have seen or heard them before.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Simon Pegg as Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please welcome <a href=#>@simonpegg</a> as Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black. <a href=#>#HogwartsLegacy</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/avWO3AgfAH</a></p>— Hogwarts Legacy (@HogwartsLegacy) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Playing the headmaster of Hogwarts, Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black, during your time in the game will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Pegg</a>.
